## 🌌 The Concept
At its core, GlyphOS is built upon the concept of a **powerful underlying engine** capable of managing complex reasoning tasks. It abstracts away the complexity of switching between tools and models, presenting a unified interface where text is the primary method of control.

Inspired by the TXTOS concept, GlyphOS enhances the terminal-like experience with modern UI capabilities, making it accessible to both developers and power users.

## 🚀 Key Features
